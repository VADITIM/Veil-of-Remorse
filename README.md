### Introduction

Veil of Remorse is a 2D top-down dungeon crawler that integrates key elements commonly found within the genre.

The game features a real-time combat system against challenging AI opponents, incorporating environmental interactions such as activating or avoiding traps to gain a strategic advantage.

Veil of Remorse features **three distinct dungeons**, each with unique themesn mechanics and randomized events (e.g. traps, chests…) accessible in a linear progression. As players advance, the **difficulty increases significantly**, encouraging them to either rerun previous dungeons to strengthen their character or adopt a **cautious and strategic playstyle** to overcome the escalating challenges.

### Gameplay

Progression is driven by a leveling system, where players earn experience points through defeating enemies and exploration, including uncovering secret rooms. Level points can be allocated toward increasing health and stamina or unlocking and enhancing abilities, with more advanced upgrades requiring a greater investment.

While Veil of Remorse follows a linear structure it introduces randomized events each playthrough of the dungeon such as different trap positions, random generated chests and different enemy positions, although the higher difficulty only applies within the next dungeons. This should encourage the player to level up their character in previous dungeons before they proceed.

~~a Gauntlet mode, which becomes accessible from the game’s lobby after defeating the first boss. This mode generates endless waves of enemies, providing an opportunity to farm XP and further develop the player’s character.~~

~~Three different dungeons with diverse thematics and mechanics are accessible linearly until the final boss has been reached.~~

Instead of traditional armor and weapon upgrades, the game utilizes artifacts, which enhance specific stats based on their properties. Players can equip up to three artifacts, each offering distinct benefits, for instance, one may increase healing effectiveness, while others enhance damage output or stamina regeneration.

Divine Points serve as checkpoints, allowing players to refill potions and allocate level points. Functioning similarly to the bonfires in Soulslike games, they provide a moment of respite before continuing the journey.
